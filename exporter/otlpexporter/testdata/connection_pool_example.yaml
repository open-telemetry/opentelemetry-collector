# Example configuration showing connection pool feature
# The connection pool is disabled by default for backward compatibility
# To enable it, you must explicitly configure it as shown below

# Example 1: Connection pool with 4 connections (recommended for high-throughput scenarios)
exporters:
  otlp/with-pool:
    endpoint: backend.example.com:4317
    connection_pool:
      size: 4

# Example 2: Default configuration (single connection, no pool)
exporters:
  otlp/default:
    endpoint: backend.example.com:4317

# Example 3: Connection pool with larger size for very high throughput
exporters:
  otlp/large-pool:
    endpoint: backend.example.com:4317
    connection_pool:
      size: 8

# Use cases for connection pooling:
# - High-latency networks where multiplexing on a single HTTP/2 connection
#   hits stream limits
# - Very high-throughput scenarios where a single connection becomes a bottleneck
# - When exporting to endpoints with high round-trip times (RTT)
#
# Note: Most deployments should continue using the default single connection.
# Only enable connection pooling when you've identified it as a bottleneck
# through monitoring and profiling.
