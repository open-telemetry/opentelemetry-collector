Serves as a placeholder exporter in a pipeline. This can be useful if you want
to e.g. start a Collector with only extensions enabled, or for testing Collector

## Getting Started

All that is required to enable the No-op exporter is to include it in the
exporter definitions. It takes no configuration.

```yaml
exporters:
  nop:
```
