  # The following example demonstrates inserting keys/values into spans.
  attributes/insert:
    actions:
      # The following inserts a new attribute {"attribute1": 123} to spans where
      # the key "attribute1" doesn't exist.
      # The type of `attribute1` is inferred by the configuration.
      #  `123` is an integer and is stored as an integer in the attributes.
      # This demonstrates how to backfill spans with an attribute that may
      # not have been sent by all clients.
      - key: "attribute1"
        value: 123
        action: insert
      # The following uses the value from attribute "anotherkey" to insert a new
      # attribute {"string key": <value from attribute "anotherkey">} to spans
      # where the key "string key" does not exist. If the attribute "anotherkey"
      # doesn't exist, no new attribute is inserted to spans.

  # The following demonstrates configuring the processor to only update existing
  # keys in an attribute.
  # Note: `action: update` must be set.
  attributes/update:

      # This demonstrates sanitizing spans of sensitive data.

  # The following demonstrates setting an attribute on both spans where the
  # key does exist and the key doesn't exist.
  attributes/upsert:
    actions:
      # The following demonstrates how to set an attribute on all spans.
      # Any spans that already had `region` now have value `planet-earth`.

      # requiring an instrumentation change.

      # is created.

  # Ex. The following are spans match the properties and the actions are applied.
