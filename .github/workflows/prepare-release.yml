#     Tag all the module groups (stable, beta) with the new release version by running the make push-tags command (e.g. make push-tags MODSET=stable and make push-tags MODSET=beta). Wait for the new tag build to pass successfully.
#     The release script for the collector builder should create a new GitHub release for the builder. This is a separate release from the core, but we might join them in the future if it makes sense.
#     A new v0.55.0 release should be automatically created on Github by now. Edit it and use the contents from the CHANGELOG.md as the release's description. At the top of the release's changelog, add a link to the releases repository where the binaries and other artifacts are landing, like:
