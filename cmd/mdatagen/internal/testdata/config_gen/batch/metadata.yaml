  properties:
    timeout:
      description: >-
        Timeout sets the time after which a batch will be sent regardless of size.
        When this is set to zero, batched data will be sent immediately.
      type: string
      format: duration
      default: "PT0.2S"
    send_batch_size:
      description: >-
        SendBatchSize is the size of a batch which after hit, will trigger it to be sent.
        When this is set to zero, the batch size is ignored and data will be sent immediately
        subject to only send_batch_max_size.
      type: integer

      goJSONSchema:

    send_batch_max_size:
      description: >-
        SendBatchMaxSize is the maximum size of a batch. It must be larger than SendBatchSize.
        Larger batches are split into smaller units.
        Default value is 0, that means no maximum size.
      type: integer
      default: 0
      minimum: 0
      goJSONSchema:
        type: uint32
    metadata_keys:
      description: >-
        MetadataKeys is a list of client.Metadata keys that will be
        used to form distinct batchers.  If this setting is empty,
        a single batcher instance will be used.  When this setting
        is not empty, one batcher will be used per distinct
        combination of values for the listed metadata keys.
        

        Empty value and unset metadata are treated as distinct cases.
        

        Entries are case-insensitive.  Duplicated entries will
        trigger a validation error.

    metadata_cardinality_limit:
      description: >-
        MetadataCardinalityLimit indicates the maximum number of
        batcher instances that will be created through a distinct
        combination of MetadataKeys.
