# {{.Name}} Collector

Welcome to your new custom OpenTelemetry Collector!
This Collector allows you to configure the components you wish to use, and only those.

Components can come from the ones provided by the OpenTelemetry organization in the
[opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib)
repository, or from any other source, including your custom private code.
The only requirement is that they match the Go interface for that component, so the Core Collector can run them.

## Important files

There are two main files you will want to tinker with here:

* `manifest.yaml` - The manifest file configures the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder and tells it what modules it need to enable within your custom collector.
  See [Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/extend/ocb/#configure-the-opentelemetry-collector-builder) doc for more information.
* `config.yaml` - The Collector configuration allows you to configure your components and their pipelines. This is where you will tell your Collector where it needs to export data.
  See the [Collector Configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) doc for more information.

## Running your custom Collector

You can already run your custom Collector, though it only includes the OTLP
receivers and exporters.

Use the following make command:

```
make run
```

This will build your collector inside the `build/collector` folder, and then
run the compiled binary.

With the `make generate` command, you can also build the collector but not run it.

## Next

To go from there, we recommend reading the [Extend the
Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/extend/) documentation,
which will give you pointers to configure your new custom Collector, and to
build custom components.
