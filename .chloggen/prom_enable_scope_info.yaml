  By default, the Collector exports its internal metrics using a Prometheus
  exporter from the opentelemetry-go repository. With this change, the Collector
  no longer sets "without_scope_info" to true in its configuration.

  This means that all exported metrics will have `otel_scope_name`,
  `otel_scope_schema_url`, and `otel_scope_version` labels corresponding to the
  instrumentation scope metadata for that metric.

  This notably prevents an error when multiple metrics are only distinguished
  by their instrumentation scopes and end up aliased during export.

  If this is not desired behavior, a Prometheus exporter can be explicitly
  configured with this option enabled.
