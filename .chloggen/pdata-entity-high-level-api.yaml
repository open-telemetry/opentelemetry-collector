  Introduces `Entity`, `EntitySlice`, and `EntityAttributeMap` types that provide a user-friendly interface
  for working with resource entities. The new API ensures consistency between entity and resource attributes
  by sharing the underlying attribute map, and prevents attribute conflicts between entities. This API may
  eventually replace the generated protobuf-based API for better usability.
