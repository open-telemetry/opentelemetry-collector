  The `metadata_keys` configuration option is now available in the `sending_queue.batch.partition` section for all exporters.
  When specified, batches are partitioned based on the values of the listed metadata keys, allowing separate batching per metadata partition. This feature
  is automatically configured when using `exporterhelper.WithQueue()`.
