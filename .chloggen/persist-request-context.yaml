  It allows internal collector spans and client metadata to propagate through the persistent queue used by 
  the exporters. The same way as it's done for the in-memory queue.
  Currently, it is behind the exporter.PersistRequestContext feature gate, which can be enabled by adding 
  `--feature-gates=exporter.PersistRequestContext` to the collector command line. An exporter buffer stored by
  a previous version of the collector (or by a collector with the feature gate disabled) can be read by a newer
  collector with the feature enabled. However, the reverse is not supported: a buffer stored by a newer collector with
  the feature enabled cannot be read by an older collector (or by a collector with the feature gate disabled).

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
