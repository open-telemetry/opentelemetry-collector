  The new `retry_on_failure.retryable_statuses` field (default: [429, 502, 503, 504]) allows
  configuring which HTTP status codes should trigger retries. Codes not in this list are treated
  as permanent errors. This is useful in gateway mode to prevent retrying rate limit errors (429)
  while still retrying server errors.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
