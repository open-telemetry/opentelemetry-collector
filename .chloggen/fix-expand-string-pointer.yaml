  For example, a resource attribute can be set via an environment variable to a string that is parseable as a number, e.g. `1234`.

  (A similar bug was fixed in a previous release: that one was triggered when the field was nested in a struct,
  whereas this one is triggered when the field internally has type "pointer to string" rather than "string".)

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
