  Metrics in metadata.yaml can now reference semantic convention definitions via `semantic_convention.ref`.
  The generated code will use semconv types for metric name, description, and unit.
  Package and type are auto-inferred from the metric name (e.g., `system.cpu.time` → `systemconv.CPUTime`).

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
