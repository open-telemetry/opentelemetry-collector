  The `service/telemetry.MeterSettings.DefaultViews` field has been removed, and replaced with
  `service/telemetry.MeterSettings.DefaultDroppedInstruments`. This new field is a function that
  returns a slice of `InstrumentSelector`s, each of which identifies a meter name and/or instrument
  name to be dropped by default. These are directly translated to views by otelconftelemetry.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [api]
