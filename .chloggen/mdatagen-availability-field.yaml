  The `optional` boolean field for attributes has been replaced with a `requirement_level` field that accepts enum values: `required`, `conditionally_required`, `recommended`, or `opt_in`.
  - `required`: attribute is always included and cannot be excluded
  - `conditionally_required`: attribute is included by default when certain conditions are met (replaces `optional: true`)
  - `recommended`: attribute is included by default but can be disabled via configuration (replaces `optional: false`)
  - `opt_in`: attribute is not included unless explicitly enabled in user config
  When `requirement_level` is not specified, it defaults to `recommended`.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
