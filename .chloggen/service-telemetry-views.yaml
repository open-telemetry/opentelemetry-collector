  The `service::telemetry::metrics::views` config key can now be used to explicitly set the list of
  metric views used for internal telemetry, mirroring `meter_provider::views` in the SDK config.
  This can be used to disable specific internal metrics, among other uses.

  This key will cause an error if used alongside other features which would normally implicitly create views, such as:
  - not setting `service::telemetry::metrics::level` to `detailed`;
  - enabling the `telemetry.disableHighCardinalityMetrics` feature flag.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
