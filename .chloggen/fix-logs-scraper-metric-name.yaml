subtext: |
  Log scrapers previously emitted the same receiver telemetry as metric scrapers,
  such as the otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points metric (instead of otelcol_receiver_accepted_log_records),
  or spans named receiver/myreceiver/MetricsReceived (instead of receiver/myreceiver/LogsReceived).

  This did not affect scraper-specific spans and metrics.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
