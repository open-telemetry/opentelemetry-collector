  The OTLP gRPC exporter can now be configured using either `otlp` or `otlp_grpc` as the exporter type.
  Both are equivalent and refer to the same OTLP gRPC exporter. The `otlp_grpc` alias makes the protocol
  explicit and helps distinguish it from the `otlphttp` exporter.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.

# Default: '[user]'
