  With the telemetry.newPipelineTelemetry feature gate enabled, the "received" and "produced"
  metrics related to a component now distinguish between two types of errors:
  - "outcome = failure" indicates that the component returned an internal error;
  - "outcome = refused" indicates that the component successfully emitted data, but returned an
    error coming from a downstream component processing that data.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
