subtext: |
  The OTLP exporter now supports connection pooling through the `connection_pool_size` configuration option.
  This helps improve performance in high-throughput environments (10K+ spans/sec) and high-latency scenarios
  by distributing load across multiple gRPC connections using round-robin load balancing.
  Default value is 1 (single connection) for backward compatibility. Recommended value for high-throughput: 4-8.
