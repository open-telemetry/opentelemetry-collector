  The feature gate is now deprecated since metric views can be configured.
  The feature gate will be removed in v0.134.0.

  The metric attributes removed by this feature gate are no longer emitted
  by the Collector by default, but if needed, you can achieve the same
  functionality by configuring the following metric views:

  ```yaml
  service:
    telemetry:
      metrics:
        level: detailed
        views:
          - selector:
              meter_name: "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc"
            stream:
              attribute_keys:
                excluded: ["net.sock.peer.addr", "net.sock.peer.port", "net.sock.peer.name"]
          - selector:
              meter_name: "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp"
            stream:
              attribute_keys:
                excluded: ["net.host.name", "net.host.port"]
  ```

  Note that this requires setting `service::telemetry::metrics::level: detailed`.
  If you have a strong use case for using views in combination with a different
  level, please show your interest in

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
