  If no converters are specified, there will be no converters added.
  Currently, the only published converter is `expandconverter` which is 
  deprecated as of v0.107.0, but can still be added for testing purposes.

  To configure a custom converter, make sure your converter implements the converter
  interface and is published as a go module (or replaced locally if not published).
  You may then use the `converters` key in your OCB build manifest with a list of
  Go modules (and replaces as necessary) to include your converter.

  Please note that converters are order-dependent. The confmap will apply converters
  in order of which they are listed in your manifest if there is more than one.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
