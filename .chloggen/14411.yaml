  The `service::telemetry::resource` configuration now accepts the declarative schema with explicit name/value pairs:
  ```yaml
  service:
    telemetry:
      resource:
        schema_url: https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/1.38.0
        attributes:
          - name: service.name
            value: my-collector
          - name: host.name
            value: collector-host
  ```

  The legacy inline attribute map format is still supported for backward compatibility:
  ```yaml
  service:
    telemetry:
      resource:
        service.name: my-collector
        host.name: collector-host
  ```

  Note: `resource.detectors` is accepted for forward compatibility but is not yet applied by the collector.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
