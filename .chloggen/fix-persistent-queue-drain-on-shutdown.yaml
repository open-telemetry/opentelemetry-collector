subtext: |
  Previously, when the collector was shutting down, the persistent queue's Read method
  checked the stopped flag before checking for remaining elements, causing consumers
  to exit immediately without draining the queue. This could result in data loss of
  spans/metrics/logs that were accepted by the receiver but not yet exported.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
