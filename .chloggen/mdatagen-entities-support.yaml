  When entities are defined, mdatagen generates `AssociateWith{EntityType}()` methods on ResourceBuilder
  that associate resources with entity types using the entity refs API. The entities section is backward
  compatible - existing metadata.yaml files without entities continue to work as before.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.

# Default: '[user]'
