subtext: |
  When `use_internal_logger` is set to `false`, the debug exporter now supports configuring the output destination via the `output_paths` option.
  This allows users to send debug exporter output to `stdout`, `stderr`, or a file path.
  The default value is `["stdout"]` to maintain backward compatibility.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
