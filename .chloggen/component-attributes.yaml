  With the feature gate enabled, all internal telemetry (metrics/traces/logs) will include some of
  the following instrumentation scope attributes:
  - `otelcol.component.kind`
  - `otelcol.component.id`
  - `otelcol.pipeline.id`
  - `otelcol.signal`
  - `otelcol.signal.output`

  These attributes are defined in the [Pipeline Component Telemetry RFC](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/rfcs/component-universal-telemetry.md#attributes),
  and identify the component instance from which the telemetry originates.
  They are added automatically without changes to component code.

  These attributes were already included in internal logs as regular log attributes, starting from
  v0.120.0. For consistency with other signals, they have been switched to scope attributes (with
  the exception of logs emitted to standard output), and are now enabled by the feature gate.

  Please make sure that the exporter / backend endpoint you use has support for instrumentation
  scope attributes before using this feature. If the internal telemetry is exported to another
  Collector, a transform processor could be used to turn them into other kinds of attributes if
  necessary.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
