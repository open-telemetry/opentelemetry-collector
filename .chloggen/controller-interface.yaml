change_type: enhancement
component: exporterhelper
note: >
  Add `RequestMiddleware` interface support to the queue sender. This allows
  extensions to intercept and manage export requests (e.g., for dynamic concurrency control).
issues: [14080]
subtext: |
  The `RequestMiddlewareFactory` interface has been added to the
  `extension/extensioncapabilities` module. The `exporterhelper`'s sending queue
  can now be configured with a `request_middleware` ID to delegate request execution logic to an extension.
