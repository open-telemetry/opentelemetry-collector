change_type: enhancement
component: exporterhelper
note: >
  Add `RequestMiddleware` interface support to the queue sender. This allows
  extensions to intercept and manage export requests (e.g., for dynamic concurrency control).
issues: [14080]
subtext: |
  The `RequestMiddleware` interface has been added to the `exporter/exporterhelper/xexporterhelper` package.
  The `exporterhelper`'s sending queue can now be configured with a list of `request_middlewares` to delegate request execution logic to extensions.
