change_type: enhancement
component: exporterhelper
note: >
  Add `ConcurrencyController` interface support to the queue sender. This allows
  extensions to dynamically control the number of concurrent requests in the
  export pipeline.
issues: [14080]
subtext: |
  The `ConcurrencyControllerFactory` interface has been added to a new
  `extension/extensioncapabilities` module. The `exporterhelper`'s sending queue
  can now be configured with a `concurrency_controller` ID to delegate flow
  control logic to an extension.
