  Strict version checking will error on major and minor version mismatches 
  between the `otelcol_version` configured and the builder version or versions 
  in the go.mod. This check can be temporarily disabled by using the `--skip-strict-versioning` 
  flag. This flag will be removed in a future minor version.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
