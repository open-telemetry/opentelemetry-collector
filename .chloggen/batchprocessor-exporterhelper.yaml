change_type: enhancement

component: processor/batch

note: batch processor implemented by exporterhelper behind feature flags

issues: [13582]

subtext: |
  there are two feature gates:
  - processor.batch.useExporterHelper: use the new implementation
  - processor.batch.propagateErrors: return errors, implies backpressure
  new features are functional however the processor produces exporter metrics,
