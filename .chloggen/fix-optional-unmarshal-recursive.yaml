  This bug notably manifested in the fact that `sending_queue::batch::sizer` stopped defaulting to `sending_queue::sizer`,
  which sometimes caused the wrong units to be used when configuring `sending_queue::batch::min_size` and `max_size`.
  
  As part of the fix, `confmap` exposes a new `confmap.WithForceUnmarshaler` option, to be used in the `Unmarshal` methods
  of wrapper types like `configoptional.Optional` to make sure the `Unmarshal` method of the inner type is called.
  
  The default behavior remains that calling `conf.Unmarshal` on the `confmap.Conf` passed as argument to an `Unmarshal`
  method will skip any top-level `Unmarshal` methods to avoid infinite recursion in standard use cases.
