  Resource attributes now require an explicit `enabled` field in metadata.yaml files, while regular attributes
  are prohibited from having this field. This improves validation and prevents configuration errors.

# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
