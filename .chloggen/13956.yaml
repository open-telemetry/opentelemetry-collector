  The `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_{spans,metric_points,log_records}` metrics now include
  failure attributes when telemetry level is Detailed: `error.type` (OpenTelemetry semantic convention
  describing the error class) and `error.permanent` (indicates if error is permanent/non-retryable).
  The `error.type` attribute captures gRPC status codes (e.g., "Unavailable", "ResourceExhausted"),
  standard Go context errors (e.g., "canceled", "deadline_exceeded"),
  and collector-specific errors (e.g., "shutdown").
  This enables better alerting and debugging by providing standardized error classification.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
