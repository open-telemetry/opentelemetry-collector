  `configopaque.MapList` is a new alternative to `map[string]configopaque.String` which can unmarshal
  both maps and lists of name/value pairs.
  
  For example, if `headers` is a field of type `configopaque.MapList`,
  then the following YAML configs will unmarshal to the same thing:
  ```yaml
  headers:
    "foo": "bar"
  
  headers:
  - name: "foo"
    value: "bar"
  ```

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [api]
