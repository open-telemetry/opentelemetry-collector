  Service telemetry now supports automatic resource attribute detection using OpenTelemetry SDK detectors.
  Configure detectors under `service.telemetry.detectors` to auto-detect environment variables, host information, and cloud metadata.
  This aligns the Collector configuration surface with the declarative schema maintained in https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-configuration (resource.yaml), while keeping extra SDK detectors available.
  To use `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variables, enable the `env` detector.
  Supported detectors: env, host, aws (ec2/ecs/eks/lambda), gcp, azure.
  Example configuration (now aligned with the declarative schema):

    service:
      telemetry:
        resource:
          attributes:
            - name: service.name
              value: otelcol
          attributes_list: deployment.environment=prod
          detection/development:
            detectors:
              - env: {}
              - host: {}
              - aws/ec2: {}
            attributes:
              excluded:
                - "cloud.account.id"

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
