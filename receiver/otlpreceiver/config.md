# Otlpreceiver Configuration Reference

This is an autogenerated file that can be used as a reference to create a collector configuration section for this component.
It contains all of the configuration fields and sub-fields accepted by this component. The fields are grouped by 'level' and
parent field, with the top level fields at the top. For compound fields, navigate to lower level fields by clicking on any
highlighted link in the Type column.

Columns:

* **Name**: The name of the field. This is the field's map key in the yaml config.
* **Type**: The golang type that the field will be converted to. Clickable to subsequent points in the document for compound
fields.
* **Default**: The default value of the field if no value is specified.
* **Docs**: Extracted inline comments explaining field usage, acceptable values, etc.

| endpoint |string| 0.0.0.0:4317 | Endpoint configures the address for this network connection. For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port". The host must be a literal IP address, or a host name that can be resolved to IP addresses. The port must be a literal port number or a service name. If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or "[fe80::1%zone]:80". The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4007.  |
| transport |string| tcp | Transport to use. Known protocols are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only), "udp", "udp4" (IPv4-only), "udp6" (IPv6-only), "ip", "ip4" (IPv4-only), "ip6" (IPv6-only), "unix", "unixgram" and "unixpacket".  |
| tls_settings |[configtls-TLSServerSetting](#configtls-TLSServerSetting)| <no value> | Configures the protocol to use TLS. The default value is nil, which will cause the protocol to not use TLS.  |
| max_recv_msg_size_mib |uint64| <no value> | MaxRecvMsgSizeMiB sets the maximum size (in MiB) of messages accepted by the server.  |
| max_concurrent_streams |uint32| <no value> | MaxConcurrentStreams sets the limit on the number of concurrent streams to each ServerTransport. It has effect only for streaming RPCs.  |
| read_buffer_size |int| 524288 | ReadBufferSize for gRPC server. See grpc.ReadBufferSize (https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#ReadBufferSize).  |
| write_buffer_size |int| <no value> | WriteBufferSize for gRPC server. See grpc.WriteBufferSize (https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#WriteBufferSize).  |
| keepalive |[configgrpc-KeepaliveServerConfig](#configgrpc-KeepaliveServerConfig)| <no value> | Keepalive anchor for all the settings related to keepalive.  |
| auth |[configauth-Authentication](#configauth-Authentication)| <no value> | Auth for this receiver  |
