  # The address has the form "host:port". The host must be a literal IP address, or a host name that can be
  # resolved to IP addresses. The port must be a literal port number or a service name.
  # If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or
  # "[fe80::1%zone]:80". The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4007.
