# check_interval is the time between measurements of memory usage for the
# purposes of avoiding going over the limits. Defaults to zero, so no
# checks will be performed. Values below 1 second are not recommended since
# it can result in unnecessary CPU consumption.
check_interval: 5s

# Maximum amount of memory, in MiB, targeted to be allocated by the process heap.

# The maximum, in MiB, spike expected between the measurements of memory usage.
